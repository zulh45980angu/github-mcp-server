The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.

### Prerequisites

1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)

### Install in VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.

Alternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:

<table>
<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>
<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {

      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.

### Configuration

#### Toolset configuration

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### Insiders Mode

> **Try new features early!** The remote server offers an insiders version with early access to new features and experimental tools.

<table>
<tr><th>Using URL Path</th><th>Using Header</th></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/insiders"
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-MCP-Insiders": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md#insiders-mode) for more details and examples, and [Insiders Features](docs/insiders-features.md) for a full list of what's available.

#### GitHub Enterprise

##### GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.

Example for `https://octocorp.ghe.com` with GitHub PAT token:

```
{
    ...
    "github-octocorp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}"
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

> **Note:** When using OAuth with GitHub Enterprise with VS Code and GitHub Copilot, you also need to configure your VS Code settings to point to your GitHub Enterprise instance - see [Authenticate from VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/authenticate-to-ghecom)

##### GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The Docker image is available at `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.
3. **Authentication.** On github.com you don't need to create anything up front — the one-click buttons above log you in with OAuth on first use (a browser-based flow; the token is kept in memory only). The Docker buttons publish a fixed callback port (`127.0.0.1:8085`) so the container's login callback is reachable. See **[Local Server OAuth Login](docs/oauth-login.md)** for how it works, headless/device-code fallback, and bringing your own OAuth or GitHub App (required for GitHub Enterprise Server and `ghe.com`).

   Prefer a token? You can still authenticate with a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) by setting `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` instead (it takes precedence over OAuth). The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

To keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:

1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Protect your `.env` file**

   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Reference the token in configurations**

   ```bash
   # CLI usage
   claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

   # In config files (where supported)
   "env": {
     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_PAT"
   }
   ```

> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
  - `repo` - Repository operations
  - `read:packages` - Docker image access
  - `read:org` - Organization team access
- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments
- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically
- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control
- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens

  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json
  ```

</details>

### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme. HTTPS is required and enforced: non-HTTPS hosts are refused so that credentials are never sent over cleartext (the only exception is a loopback host such as `http://localhost` for local development).
- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.

``` json
"github": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_HOST",
    "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}",
        "GITHUB_HOST": "https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>"
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

Install in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)

Add one of the following JSON blocks to your IDE's MCP settings.

**Log in with OAuth (no token to create or store).** On github.com the official image already includes the app credentials, so you provide none yourself: it runs a browser-based login on first use and keeps the resulting token **in memory only**. In Docker this needs a fixed callback port published to loopback so the container's login callback is reachable:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-p",
          "127.0.0.1:8085:8085",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT": "8085"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See **[Local Server OAuth Login](docs/oauth-login.md)** for the native-binary flow (no fixed port needed), the headless/device-code fallback, GitHub Enterprise Server / `ghe.com`, and bringing your own OAuth or GitHub App.

For non-interactive stdio deployments, see **[GitHub App Authentication](docs/github-app-auth.md)**.

**Or authenticate with a Personal Access Token.** Set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` instead (it takes precedence over OAuth):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "github_token",
        "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.

{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "github_token",
      "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",

        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.

> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.

### Build from source

If you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "/path/to/github-mcp-server",
        "args": ["stdio"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

> **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with toolsets.

#### Specifying Toolsets

To specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security" ./github-mcp-server
   ```

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.

#### Specifying Individual Tools

You can also configure specific tools using the `--tools` flag. Tools can be used independently or combined with toolsets for fine-grained control.

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLS="get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request" ./github-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Combining with Toolsets** (additive):

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues --tools get_gist
   ```

   This registers all tools from `repos` and `issues` toolsets, plus `get_gist`.

**Important Notes:**

- Tools and toolsets can be used together
- Read-only mode takes priority: write tools are skipped if `--read-only` is set, even if explicitly requested via `--tools`
- Tool names must match exactly (e.g., `get_file_contents`, not `getFileContents`). Invalid tool names will cause the server to fail at startup with an error message
- When tools are renamed, old names are preserved as aliases for backward compatibility. See [Tool Renaming](docs/tool-renaming.md) for details.

### Using Toolsets With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Using Tools With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass specific tools as environment variables. You can also combine tools with toolsets:

```bash
# Tools only
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS="get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

# Tools combined with toolsets (additive)
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues" \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS="get_gist" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Special toolsets

#### "all" toolset

The special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:

```bash
./github-mcp-server --toolsets all
```

Or using the environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="all" ./github-mcp-server
```

#### "default" toolset

The default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.

The default configuration is:

- context
- repos
- issues
- pull_requests
- users

To keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="default,stargazers" ./github-mcp-server
```

### Insiders Mode

The local GitHub MCP Server offers an insiders version with early access to new features and experimental tools.

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   ./github-mcp-server --insiders
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_INSIDERS=true ./github-mcp-server
   ```

When using Docker:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_INSIDERS=true \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available:

<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->
|     | Toolset                 | Description                                                   |

<summary>Copilot Spaces</summary>

- **Authentication note**
  - Fine-grained PATs are not hidden by classic PAT scope filtering, so these tools may still appear even when the token cannot use them.
  - For org-owned spaces, fine-grained PATs must be installed on the owning organization and include `organization_copilot_spaces: read`.
  - If an org-owned space contains repository-backed resources, the token must also have access to every referenced repository or the space may be treated as not found.

- **get_copilot_space** - Get Copilot Space
  - `owner`: The owner of the space. (string, required)
  - `name`: The name of the space. (string, required)

- **list_copilot_spaces** - List Copilot Spaces

Support topics include: GitHub Actions Workflows, Authentication, GitHub Support Inquiries, Pull Request Practices, Repository Maintenance, GitHub Pages, GitHub Packages, GitHub Discussions, Copilot Spaces
  - `query`: Input from the user about the question they need answered. This is the latest raw unedited user message. You should ALWAYS leave the user message as it is, you should never modify it. (string, required)

</details>

## Read-Only Mode

To run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --read-only
```

When using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

## Lockdown Mode

Lockdown mode limits the content that the server will surface from public repositories. When enabled, the server checks whether the author of each item has push access to the repository. Private repositories are unaffected, and collaborators keep full access to their own content.

Lockdown mode is a best-effort content filter intended to reduce the risk of prompt injection from untrusted repository content (issues, pull requests, comments, commits, etc.). It is **not** an authorization boundary: it does not change what the underlying GitHub credential can read or write, and content withheld from a filtered tool response may still be reachable through other tools or direct GitHub API access with the same credential.

As an intentional exception, content authored by a small set of trusted bot accounts (currently `github-actions[bot]` and `copilot`) is always treated as safe, regardless of push access. This avoids filtering routine automation output (e.g. CI-generated commits or comments) that would otherwise be withheld under lockdown mode.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --lockdown-mode
```

When running with Docker, set the corresponding environment variable:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

In HTTP mode, this flag (or `GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE`) is an upper bound: the `X-MCP-Lockdown` request header can enable lockdown mode when the operator has not, but it cannot disable lockdown mode the operator has already enabled. See the [Server Configuration Guide](docs/server-configuration.md#lockdown-mode) for details.

The behavior of lockdown mode depends on the tool invoked.

Following tools will return an error when the author lacks the push access:

- `issue_read:get`
- `pull_request_read:get`
- `pull_request_read:get_diff`
- `pull_request_read:get_files`
- `pull_request_read:get_commits`

Following tools will filter out content from users lacking the push access:

- `issue_read:get_comments`
- `issue_read:get_sub_issues`
- `pull_request_read:get_comments`
- `pull_request_read:get_review_comments`
- `pull_request_read:get_reviews`

## i18n / Overriding Descriptions

The descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a
`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.

The file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new
descriptions as values. For example:

```json
{
  "TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION": "an alternative description",
  "TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION": "Create a new branch in a GitHub repository"
}
```

You can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with
the `--export-translations` flag.

This flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding
any new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you
exported.

```sh
./github-mcp-server --export-translations
cat github-mcp-server-config.json
```

You can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment
variable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with
`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.

For example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can
set the following environment variable:

```sh
export GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION="an alternative description"
```

### Overriding Server Name and Title

The same override mechanism can be used to customize the MCP server's `name` and
`title` fields in the initialization response. This is useful when running
multiple GitHub MCP Server instances (e.g., one for github.com and one for
GitHub Enterprise Server) so that agents can distinguish between them.

| Key | Environment Variable | Default |
|-----|---------------------|---------|
| `SERVER_NAME` | `GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_NAME` | `github-mcp-server` |
| `SERVER_TITLE` | `GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_TITLE` | `GitHub MCP Server` |

For example, to configure a server instance for GitHub Enterprise Server:

```json
{
  "SERVER_NAME": "ghes-mcp-server",
  "SERVER_TITLE": "GHES MCP Server"
}
```

Or using environment variables:

```sh
export GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_NAME="ghes-mcp-server"
export GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_TITLE="GHES MCP Server"
```

## Library Usage

The exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.
